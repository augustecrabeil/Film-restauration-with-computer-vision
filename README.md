# Project Structure

- /Colorize: Contains the pretrained model used for colorization.
- /.: Contains: - the sample video used for this project;
  - the scripts for the stabilization, denoising, frame interpolation and colorization;
  - the output video after our different modification;
  - the report for the class in which we do this project.

# Installation

In the beginning of each notebook, the list of required libraries is provided in the first cell where they are imported.

# Usage

Every jupyter notebook is independant from the others. In each notebook, you have:

1) The imports of the required libraries
2) The load of the sample video
3) The algorithme for the different modification of the sample video
4) The output video

You can execute these different cells in this order and you will get our results.

# Results

The results are describe in the report. For the final video, we just apply our different modification on the sample video.
